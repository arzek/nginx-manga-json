живет в городке под названием Аомори, расположенном в горах Шираками, и очень любит фестивали. В один прекрасный день, он приезжает на самый большой фестиваль моды в Японии, дабы посетить \"Токийскую женскую коллекцию\". Не смотря на то, что у него нет билета, Ямато проникает внутрь, где сразу же натыкается на двух ссорящихся моделей и с успехом разруливает ситуацию между ними. Через некоторое время Ямато получает предложение стать шеф-продюсером.
