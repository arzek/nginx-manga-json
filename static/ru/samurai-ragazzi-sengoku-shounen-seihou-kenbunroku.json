округ из Кушу, управляется семьей Харима, во главе 15-летнего Харунобу, который. несмотря на надежды каждого и будучи господином, не имеет никакого интереса к войне. Вместо этого он проводит свое время, рассматривая землю, для составления карт или записи растительного и животного мира. Мечта Харунобу- создание энциклопедии, которая содержит всю информацию о мире. Поэтому, когда появляется возможность путешествия по миру, конечный пункт которого - Рим, Харунобу оставляет землю в умелых руках и отправляется в плавание, о котором, он мечтал всю свою жизнь.","translationFull":["Зеленый день"],"mangaka":["Kaneda Tatsuya"],"transStatus":"Глав: 5, перевод продолжается","status":"Томов: 10, выпуск завершен","middleUrl":"manga","img":"/showfull/uploads/posts/2016-09/thumbs/1472709354_9784063801439_w.jpg","altName":"samurai-ragazzi-sengoku-shounen-seihou-kenbunroku","rating":18,"title":"Самурай Рагацу (Samurai Ragazzi - Sengoku Shounen Seihou Kenbunroku)","apiId":60483,"__v":0}
